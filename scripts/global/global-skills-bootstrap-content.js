2. Run \`repo-standards-router\` for task classification and gates.
3. Load \`openclaw-universal-system\` as the machine-global OpenClaw baseline.
4. For tasks that could benefit from remote execution or offloading, load \`network-platform-resources\`.
5. For OpenClaw-backed execution, load \`openclaw-availability-utilization\` and enforce preflight + utilization checks.
6. For runtime/UI changes, run \`web-regression-governance\` before final validation.
7. For GitHub governance controls, hand off to \`github-ops-tree-router\`.
8. Run \`workflow-self-anneal\` only after failures or process drift.
9. Keep changes additive and preserve existing repository instructions.`;

   - \`repo-standards-router\` for task classification and gates
   - \`openclaw-universal-system\` as the machine-global OpenClaw baseline when OpenClaw might help
   - \`network-platform-resources\` when task could benefit from remote execution or offloading
   - \`openclaw-availability-utilization\` when OpenClaw lane is expected or preferred
   - \`workflow-self-anneal\` only for post-failure/process drift checks
