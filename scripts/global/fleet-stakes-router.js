/**
 * Fleet Advisor — keep-warm pool + deterministic stakes-based routing (Epic #3414 #3484, §Q1/Q2).
 *
 * The F2 worked example from the Phase-0 design: on a one-GPU host a 7B fits GPU-resident (fast) while
 * a 32B runs CPU-offloaded (slow, >10-min cold load). So route the COMMON path to the resident 7B and
 * reserve the 32B for genuine high-stakes work — and keep the 7B WARM so the first dispatch isn't a
 * cold load. This module is the deterministic decision layer (pure + testable); cascade-dispatch wires
 * it to the live dispatch and threads the chosen `keep_alive` through.
 *
 * Composition with per_role_lane_preferences (#2320): the lane preference chooses free/fleet/haiku/
 * premium; this gate only decides 7B-vs-32B *within* the fleet lane — it never overrides the lane.
