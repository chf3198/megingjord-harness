When asked to "complete" a feature-add (or equivalent language), all four baton roles are required.
Do not stop at "tests pass" — tests passing only closes Collaborator.
See `role-baton-routing.instructions.md` for the full sequence.

## Admin completion contract (required before claiming done)

- Version collision check (Marketplace/tag/package alignment)
- Commit + push + PR creation with issue linkage
- CI green verification
- Merge
- Publish/release work (if applicable)
- Release integrity verification
- Issue closure comment with released version evidence

## Documentation coverage matrix (required)

For behavior/config changes, confirm all applicable docs are updated:
- root README
- extension README
- root + extension CHANGELOG
- design docs (system-stability and related)
- contributor/governance docs (.github/CONTRIBUTING, PR template)
- public profile/community docs when workflow changes impact contributors

If any item is intentionally N/A, state N/A + reason explicitly.

Never claim "feature complete" with uncommitted worktree changes.
