# Role Baton Routing (v2.0)

The GitHub issue **is** the baton. One active role at a time. Every state carries exactly one
`role:*` label — no exceptions, including closed tickets.

Authoritative board: **Megingjord Harness Board** (GitHub Projects).
Baton view filter: `status:triage,ready,in-progress,testing,review` (backlog/done/cancelled/dormant/deferred hidden from active baton view).

## Status Workflow (10-state taxonomy v1.1, aligned with `instructions/ticket-driven-work.instructions.md`)

```
Status         Role Label          Gate / Trigger
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
backlog        — (Epic: manager)   Created; not yet scoped
triage         role:manager        Manager actively scoping AC + gates
ready          —                   MANAGER_HANDOFF emitted; awaiting Collaborator pickup
in-progress    role:collaborator   Implementation active (Epic: role:manager per Rule E3)
testing        role:admin          COLLABORATOR_HANDOFF emitted; CI gates running
review         role:consultant     ADMIN_HANDOFF emitted; critique + closeout active
done           — (terminal)        CONSULTANT_CLOSEOUT emitted; issue closed
cancelled      — (terminal)        Goal invalidated; Manager authority
dormant        role:manager        Epic-only: paused; 90d EPIC_REVIEW (Rule E5)
deferred       role:manager        Epic-only: blocked, no ETA (Rule E5)
measuring      (sub-state of in-progress) Epic-only: time-windowed AC awaiting elapse (Rule E6, #1271 AC4)
```

### Rule E6 — `status:measuring` carve-out

Per Epic #1271 AC4, `status:measuring` is a **sub-state of `status:in-progress`** for Epics blocked only by an elapsed-time AC. Existence of `status:measuring` implies `status:in-progress` is also present. Body schema: `Recheck-after: <ISO-date>`, `Measure-window: <duration>`, `Sensor: <owner>`. Daily cron (`measuring-recheck.yml`) auto-comments when `Recheck-after` elapses. Label-lint MUST allow the pair (`status:in-progress` + `status:measuring`); single-status-only invariant is relaxed for this pair only.

## Transition Guards

- `backlog → triage`: Manager picks up; applies `role:manager`.
- `triage → ready`: MANAGER_HANDOFF posted; remove `role:manager` (no role on `ready`).
- `ready → in-progress`: Collaborator picks up; applies `role:collaborator`.
- `in-progress → testing`: COLLABORATOR_HANDOFF; all ACs ✅; swap to `role:admin`.
- `testing → review`: ADMIN_HANDOFF; all gates pass; swap to `role:consultant`.
- `review → done`: CONSULTANT_CLOSEOUT; remove `role:consultant`; close issue (atomic).
- `any → cancelled`: Manager authority — remove current `role:*`; post `CANCELLATION: <reason>`; close as "not planned".
- `in-progress ↔ dormant` (Epic-only): Manager pauses; carries `role:manager` per Rule E2.
- `in-progress ↔ deferred` (Epic-only): Manager flags external blocker; carries `role:manager`.
- Manager ticket-health checks, AC edits, and label fixes are out-of-band; no handoff required.

## Collaborator role

Per v1.1 taxonomy, the active label is `role:collaborator` (not the older `role:collab-{type}` form). Capability profile is reflected in ticket area labels (`area:scripts`, `area:hooks`, `area:dashboard`, etc.) rather than role-suffix typing. Each Collaborator may have only **1 `in-progress` ticket at a time** (enforced by baton-gates Action).

## Multi-Lane Definition of Done

| Lane         | Work type                      | Role sequence                     | N/A markers                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| code-change  | Code, infra, deploy (default)  | Manager→Collab→Admin→Consultant   | none                           |
| research     | Analysis, wiki — no git branch | Manager→Collab(analyst)→Admin→Consultant | Admin = doc reviewer, not CI |
| config-only  | Single-value config, no design | Manager→Admin→Consultant          | COLLABORATOR_HANDOFF: N/A      |

Lane set at ticket creation via `lane:*` label and `Lane` Project field. Default: **code-change**.

## Archival

Closed tickets retain `role:manager`. A nightly Action swaps `role:manager` → `role:archived`
on issues closed >30 days. Archived tickets are excluded from all dashboard and baton queries.

## Hard Rules

- `role:*` is never null — exactly one present at all times.
- No concurrent role execution on a single ticket.
- Emit the named handoff artifact before transitioning to the next role.
- `ADMIN_HANDOFF` signer identity must differ from `COLLABORATOR_HANDOFF`.
- All governed work requires a GitHub issue and `Refs #N` in the PR body.
- Skip baton only for: single Q&A, read-only lookup, no file edits, no state-changing tool calls.

## Enforcement Points

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Collaborator/Admin signer independence | `baton-gates.yml` admin-gate blocks identical signer identity |
| Test strategy declared per matrix | `test-evidence.yml` gate consumes `test_strategy` from `MANAGER_HANDOFF` |

## MANAGER_HANDOFF schema (with test_strategy)

Required fields on every `MANAGER_HANDOFF` comment:
- `scope:` — what changes
- `lane:` — `lane:code-change | lane:docs-research | lane:config-only | lane:trivial`
- `test_strategy:` — one of `tdd-pyramid | tdd-trophy | contract-test | golden-file | eval-harness | visual-regression | drift-lint | peer-review | manual-verify | none`
- `acceptance:` — AC checklist
- `gates:` — CI/governance gates that must pass

`test_strategy` is selected per `instructions/test-methodology-matrix.instructions.md`.
Soft default: missing field on legacy/pre-rollout tickets is treated as `none` with a Manager-warning advisory comment. New tickets with `none` on a non-permitted lane fail the `test-evidence` gate.

## Local Override

A repo may override via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; local wins on conflict.

## Skill Mapping

Manager: `role-manager-execution` | Collaborator: `role-collaborator-execution`
Admin: `role-admin-execution` | Consultant: `role-consultant-critique`
Orchestration: `role-baton-orchestrator`
