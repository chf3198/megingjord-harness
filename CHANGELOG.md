- `docs/HELP-GUIDELINES.md`: HELP panel UX patterns — section-id taxonomy (`start-*`, `use-*`, `trouble-*`, `dev-*`), body HTML conventions, file-size discipline, wikilink rules.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`: index for the 11 ADRs in `research/adr/` (canonical store) with how-to-add-a-new-ADR guidance.

## [Unreleased] — HTTP Handler Sync-Call Guard (#723)

### Added
- `scripts/global/no-sync-http-handlers.js`: fails when `execSync` or `spawnSync` appears in dashboard HTTP handler files.
- `package.json`: added `governance:no-sync-http` script.

### Changed

## [Unreleased] — Docs Drift Detector and CI Gate (#722)

### Added
- `scripts/docs-lint.js`: deterministic docs-drift checker. Validates that every `npm run X` token in `dashboard/js/help-*.js` resolves to a real `package.json` script, every `[[wikilink]]` resolves to a real wiki page in `~/.copilot/wiki/concepts/` or `~/.copilot/wiki/entities/`, and warns on `instructions/*.md` files older than 90 days.
- `.github/workflows/docs-lint.yml`: NEW workflow that runs `npm run docs:lint` on PRs touching HELP, instructions, scripts, or package.json. Syncs `wiki/` to `~/.copilot/wiki/` before the check.
- `package.json`: added `docs:lint` script.

## [Unreleased] — HELP Wikilinks and help:topic CLI (#718)

### Added
- `dashboard/js/help-content.js`: `renderWikiLinks(body)` transforms `[[page-name]]` patterns in help section bodies into Alpine-wired anchor tags that switch the dashboard to Wiki view.
- `scripts/help-topic.js`: CLI script; `npm run help:topic -- <term>` searches the local LLM wiki and prints results to stdout.
- `package.json`: added `help:topic` script.

### Changed
- `dashboard/js/help-user.js`: five help sections (baton, context-flow, governance, ticket-log, devices) now include a "Learn more: [[wiki-page]]" wikilink.
- `dashboard/js/help-dev.js`: three developer sections (architecture, contributing, skills) now include wikilinks.

## [Unreleased] — Release Smoke Governance Wiring (#719)

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml`: now executes `tests/no-network-errors.spec.js` and `tests/api-smoke.spec.js` in required quality checks.

## [Unreleased] — Epic Close-Readiness Gate (#452)

### Added
- `.github/workflows/epic-close-readiness.yml`: detects when a `type:epic` issue is closed while child issues referencing it remain open; posts a violation comment listing open children and re-opens the epic automatically.

## [Unreleased] — Governance Integrity Automation Hardening (#657)

### Added
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml`: added `Ticket reconciliation` step and `issues:read` permission for PR/merge-group governance validation.
- `scripts/global/ticket-reconcile.js`: detects local `tickets/*.md` files without matching GitHub issues and fails when drift exists.
- `scripts/global/ticket-reconcile-baseline.json`: baseline allowlist for known historical ticket-ID gaps so only net-new drift fails CI.
- `package.json`: added `governance:reconcile` script.

### Changed
- `.github/workflows/label-lint.yml`: auto-reopens issues closed without terminal status labels, strips `role:*` labels on close, and enforces exactly one `lane:*` label at `status:ready`.
- `.github/workflows/baton-gates.yml`: lightweight lanes (`lane:docs-research`, `lane:docs-only`, `lane:trivial`) skip collaborator/admin artifact requirements.
- `.github/workflows/evidence-completeness.yml`: lightweight lanes skip collaborator timing enforcement.
- `.github/workflows/label-scan.yml`: corrected pinned `actions/github-script` digest.

## [Unreleased] — Context Flow Event-Animation CSS Classes (#706)

### Added — Context Flow Animations Foundation
- `dashboard/css/context.css`: `@keyframes cf-pulse` (3s ease-out drop-shadow pulse), `.cf-active` (event-triggered animation class), and `.cf-idle` (dim to opacity 0.35); prerequisite for SSE-driven event-wiring module (#707)

- `model-compare/design-analysis/LLM-EVALUATION-MATRIX.md`: new `qwen2.5-coder:7b` row with live benchmark data (1.3 TPS CPU, empirical score 7.0); `phi3:mini` and `mistral:latest` marked `⚠ not installed`
- `wiki/entities/openclaw.md`: updated models-available section with live benchmarks; added CPU-only performance constraints; documented `qwen2.5-coder:7b` cold-start behavior

## [Unreleased] — Wiki Section Popularity Auto-Record (#328)

### Fixed — Wiki Health Metrics
- `dashboard/js/wiki-reader.js`: `renderWikiReader` now auto-calls `trackWikiAccess` for each loaded section at most once per hour (debounced via `_lastAutoRecord` + `AUTO_RECORD_INTERVAL_MS`), so section popularity updates without requiring manual user clicks
- `tests/wiki-popularity.spec.js`: 4 Playwright tests covering section bar render, empty-state display, section click request tracking, and auto-record trigger

## [Unreleased] — Baton Step Fleet Resource Tooltips (#329)

### Added — Fleet Resource Visibility
- `dashboard/js/baton-flow.js`: each baton step `title` tooltip now shows resource type (fleet/cloud), agent name, and model for the active role; done steps show "✓ done"; pending steps show "pending" — uses `/^(qwen|llama|mistral|phi|gemma)/` regex to classify fleet vs cloud models
- `tests/baton-step-resource.spec.js`: 5 Playwright tests covering fleet-type detection, cloud-type detection, agent name in tooltip, model name in tooltip, and done-step label

## [Unreleased] — Agent Baton Last Comment Snippet (#326)

## [Unreleased] — GitHub-API Drift Scan + Epic Close Validator (#359)

### Added — Live Governance Scanning
- `scripts/global/governance-github-scanner.js`: paginates all GitHub issues via REST API, checks 5 ADR-010 rules (closed+role, done+role, missing active-status role, epic+ready, multi-status), returns classified violations
- `scripts/global/epic-close-validator.js`: checks all open `type:epic` issues for close-readiness (status:review, open child count via timeline, CONSULTANT_CLOSEOUT comment)
- `governance:epics` npm script

### Changed — Governance Drift Pipeline
- `scripts/global/governance-drift-classifier.js`: now async; calls `governance-github-scanner.js` when `GITHUB_TOKEN` set, merges `githubViolations` into drift report
- `.github/workflows/drift-detection.yml`: passes `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_REPOSITORY` to drift step; adds epic close-readiness summarize step

## [Unreleased] — ADR-010 Lifecycle Enforcement + Daily Scan (#358)

- `.github/workflows/label-lint.yml`: Rule 7 (closed+role), Rule 8 (positive role per active status), Rule 9 (epic+status:ready guard)
- `.github/workflows/label-scan.yml`: new scheduled daily ADR-010 scan of all issues with idempotent violation comments

## [Unreleased] — End-to-End Anneal Verification Reliability (#683)

### Changed
- `scripts/global/consultant-checks.js`: `gov-003` now accepts baton evidence from either `logs/fleet-health.jsonl` or `.dashboard/events.jsonl` (`baton:handoff`) to avoid false FAILs when fleet-health logs are telemetry-only.
- `scripts/global/consultant-checks.js`: `fleet-003` now recognizes local utilization from either explicit `provider:"ollama"` entries or `lane:"fleet"` telemetry rows.

## [Unreleased] — Consultant SKILL.md Updates (#682)

### Changed
- `skills/role-consultant-critique/SKILL.md`: Added Comprehensive Check Registry section, Manager Feedback Protocol step, and extended output contract with `checks_run`, `checks_failed`, `remediation_issues` fields.

## [3.2.0] — Rebrand: DevEnv Ops → Megingjord (2026-04-29)

### Changed — Global Rebrand
- Package name: `devenv-ops` → `megingjord-harness`
- Repository title: "devenv-ops" → "Megingjord"
- Core documentation and plugin metadata updated to Megingjord branding
- Added `NAMING_RESEARCH_2026.md` with naming research and recommendation

### Why Rebrand?
Megingjord better positions the harness as a **governance-first** AI agent orchestration tool. Research into current naming patterns identified Megingjord as:
- **Distinctive + memorable** (vs. generic "DevOps" nomenclature)
- **Governance-aligned semantics** (protection, guardrails, policy)
- **Lower naming-conflict risk** after rejecting "Codex" due OpenAI brand collision and "Aegis" due broad prior use

## [Unreleased] — Request Queuing + Exponential Backoff (#670)

### Added — Rate-Limit Resilience
- `scripts/global/backoff.js`: `backoff(attempt, opts)` — exponential delay with 20% jitter, capped at 60s; `isRateLimitError(err)` — matches HTTP 429/503 and message patterns
- `scripts/global/request-queue.js`: `RequestQueue` with priority lanes (urgent/normal/low), RPS throttle, adaptive backpressure (RPS drops on task failure), max queue 500, `getStats()`, `drain()`
- `scripts/global/cascade-dispatch.js`: `tryOllama` now retries up to 3 times on rate-limit errors using `backoff.js`; graceful escalation after max retries

## [Unreleased] — Fleet Quantization Strategy + Device Inventory (#669)

- `dashboard/js/app.js`: wired `costData` into Alpine data object; populated in `refreshAll()`
- `scripts/dashboard-server.js`: `/api/logs/cost-telemetry` endpoint serving `logs/cost-telemetry.jsonl`; 404 when absent

## [Unreleased] — Cost Telemetry + Routing Discipline (#668)

### Added — Cost Accounting per Dispatch
- `scripts/global/cost-telemetry.js`: per-dispatch cost logger writing `logs/cost-telemetry.jsonl`; computes `cost_usd` per tier at 2026 blended pricing; budget alert at 80% of $10/mo

## [Unreleased] — Verification Baseline + Cost Measurement (#671)

### Added — Cost Baseline Tooling
- `scripts/global/cost-baseline.js`: before/after comparison tool; reads `logs/cost-telemetry.jsonl`, shows current projected monthly cost vs pre-optimization baseline ($60.38/mo, ~1090 req, 100% premium); outputs savings delta
- `npm run cost:baseline`: runs cost-baseline.js for 30-day window comparison

## [Unreleased] — Instruction Token Footprint Reduction (#667)

### Changed — Instruction Optimization
- 15 instruction files reduced by 877 words (15.0%) with no governance regression

## [Unreleased] — Governance Verifier Hygiene (#652)

### Fixed — Governance Verifier False Positives
- `scripts/global/governance-verify.js`: removed `Signed-by:` requirement from local ticket files; baton record lives in GitHub comments (enforced by baton-gate CI). Eliminated 53 false-positive drift findings covering 98% of all tickets
- Bulk label cleanup: stripped lingering `role:*` labels from 9 closed issues and corrected `status:*` labels on 26 closed issues (no-status, wrong-status, backlog/review on closed state)

## [Unreleased] — Wiki Critical Audit and Structural Repair (#651)

### Fixed — LLM Wiki Health
- `scripts/wiki/lint.js`: orphan detection now counts `index.md` references as inbound links (index was excluded from link graph, causing false orphan reports for all indexed pages)
- Repaired frontmatter on 9 wiki pages (plural type fields corrected, missing `created`/`status` added)
- Fixed `concepts/github-integration.md`: `category:` → `type:`, added `related` field

## [Unreleased] — Sandbox Launcher Sync (#647)

### Added — Worktree Governance Automation
- `.github/workflows/post-merge-sandbox-sync.yml`: fires on push to `main`; force-resets `sandbox/copilot`, `sandbox/codex`, `sandbox/claude-code` to the new main SHA via the GitHub REST API — closes the gap where `worktree-governance-required` enforced currency but no automation maintained it
