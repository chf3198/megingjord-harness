## [2026-05-05] convergence | Megingjord Harness Convergence Design v1 (#922, 9-round 3-team SIGN_OFF)
Approved cross-team architecture: 4 axes (governance / tooling / fleet / HAMR) plus Dashboard as observation/control plane. HAMR is shared substrate maintained by Claude Code Team. substrate-health gates model-routing-engine UPSTREAM of cascade-dispatch via cascade-policy-overrides.json. Per-team config markers extended with axis_consumers. SKILL.md frontmatter is canonical tool-discovery format with auto-derived per-team views. Cross-team edits on shared files via baton + governance-lint warn. megingjord-coord deprecation and Dashboard HAMR opt-in (#966) deferred to downstream Epics. 3 consecutive SIGN_OFFs (Codex/Copilot/Claude Code) at rounds 7/8/9. Authored as fast-track operator-deputy passes per operator authorization.

**Tip**: `grep "^## \[" log.md | tail -5` shows last 5 entries.

## [2026-05-05] ingest | VS Code Copilot allow-prompt avoidance (Epic #849)
Added workspace-trust + approvals research to the Karpathy wiki so sessions can
avoid repeated "Allow" interruptions. New pages:
`wiki/sources/vscode-copilot-allow-prompts-2026-05-05.md` and
`wiki/concepts/workspace-write-boundary-discipline.md`. Core policy: keep writes
inside repo workspace root and never edit runtime homes directly from this repo
session; use repo-mediated deploy flow instead. Source:
research/dashboard-liveness-workspace-trust-2026-05-05.md.

## [2026-05-05] ingest | Dashboard live-data methodology (Epic #849)
Added dashboard liveness contract source page documenting SSE vs polling split,
panel refresh cadence, staleness signaling, and forced refresh on delayed-mount
views. New page: `wiki/sources/dashboard-live-data-methodology-2026-05-05.md`.

## [2026-05-05] research | HAMR v3.2.2 patch — R9.2 cwd-vs-branch hook enforcement (#923, EPIC #860)
Pre-Wave-4 alignment patch extending v3.2.1 §R9.2 with three sub-patterns:
R9.2.1 Bash-hook contract (pre-tool guard asserts HEAD non-detached + no
in-progress rebase + branch matches EXPECTED_BRANCH); R9.2.2 `gh pr create`
MUST pass explicit `--head <ref>` flag (cwd-resolved head BANNED); R9.2.3
branch-ops audit log at ~/.megingjord/branch-ops.log. Triggered by 3
empirical hazard occurrences during HAMR Waves 1–3 (PR cwd-resolution
landing commits on wrong/Copilot branches). Implementation deferred to a
separate development child ticket spawned post-merge. Source:
research/hamr-v3-2-2-2026-05-05.md.

## [2026-05-05] research | HAMR v3.2.1 patch — R9 + §R6 update + Copilot coordination (#907, EPIC #860)
Pre-Wave-2 alignment patch amending v3.2 (#890). Bundles three deltas:
(1) R9 NEW cross-level resource-failure recovery — four Wave-1-validated
patterns (worktree-isolation, cwd-vs-branch pre-flight, sequential dispatch
with backoff + family-fallback, idempotent infrastructure tear-down);
(2) §R6 binary→3-stage gate (Stage-1 deterministic ≥99% keyword unchanged;
Stage-2a free-fleet ≥80% direct+counter-factual; Stage-2b paid-tier ≥95%
with boundary; Stage-3 operator review for <0.50). v3.2 §R6 ≥97% threshold
unachievable per #893 finding;
(3) Copilot Team v2.0 baton-routing coordination note (Wave-5 sync required;
not Wave 2/3/4 blocking). v3.2 stays unmodified; v3.2 + v3.2.1 are combined
input contract for Wave 2. Source: research/hamr-v3-2-1-2026-05-05.md.

## [2026-05-05] validation | HAMR Wave 1 S5 Stage-2 reasoning quiz (#893, EPIC #860)
60-Q quiz authored across direct (30) / counter-factual (20) / boundary (10);
20-Q balanced subset run via judge-quorum.js #895 with Cerebras qwen-3-235b
(family qwen, with Gemini-2.5-flash fallback) and Groq llama-3.3-70b (family
llama). Direct mean 0.55 (30% ≥0.97 / 80% ≥0.50); counter-factual mean 0.50
(33% / 67%); boundary 0% (judges did not chain reasoning). Family-fallback
Cerebras → Gemini covered 14/14 queue-exceeded calls — architecture VALIDATED.
v3.2 §R6 ≥97% threshold is NOT achievable with free-fleet quorum; REVISE to
3-stage gate (Stage-2a free-fleet ≥80% direct+counter-factual; Stage-2b paid
≥95% including boundary; Stage-3 operator review). Net spend $0 (free fleet).

## [2026-05-05] validation | HAMR Wave 1 S3 — Live CF Worker + KV latency (#891, EPIC #860)
Live throwaway Worker + KV deploy at hamr-spike.chf3198.workers.dev. R2 substituted
with KV (R2 needs one-time operator dashboard ToS; KV is same Workers-Paid plan,
same bound-storage round-trip). 60 samples (30 cold + 29 warm after dropping
prime call). Measured cold p50 114.6 / p95 153.3 ms (within v3.2 §R4 ≤180 ms p95);
warm p50 37.4 / p95 45.4 ms (BEATS v3.2 §R4 ≤80/120 ms by ~2×). Decisions: CONFIRM
v3.2 §R4 thresholds; revise `npx megingjord init` sample to 40 ms p50 / 50 ms p95;
HTTP/2 keepalive + KV edge-cache mandates ratified; R2 enablement deferred to
operator dashboard step (add to hamr:doctor remediation list). Tear-down verified
HTTP 404. Net subscription cost $0. Source:
research/hamr-wave1-s3-live-deploy-2026-05-05.md.
## [2026-05-05] validation | HAMR Wave 1 S4 — Live Anthropic cache measurement (#892, EPIC #860)
20 live calls to claude-sonnet-4-5 with 14,073-token HAMR governance bundle
(instructions/* + 4 wiki concept pages). Total spend $0.18 (under $0.50 cap).
Measured reductions: 5m ephemeral 83.82% (1 write + 9 reads, 90% hit), 1h
extended 90.59% (10 reads, 100% hit on warm cache). Both EXCEED v3's 72%
claim (+11.8 pp / +18.6 pp). CONFIRM v3 §R5: 1-h extended cache as default;
80% hit-rate floor preserved; ≥5 min bundle-rebuild rate-limit unchanged.
Source: research/hamr-wave1-s4-live-cache-2026-05-05.md.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR v3.2 — post-spike redesign baseline (#890, EPIC #860)
Design baseline after the 6-spike validation gate. Substrate (CF Worker + R2
+ KV + MCP + Tailscale fleet) survives; trust model, latency contract, cache
strategy, compression gate, key storage, judge gate, and failover semantics
are revised. 8 remediations (R1–R8). 4-tier OS-agnostic key store (T1
hardware enclave → T2 OS keychain → T3 Age file → T4 ephemeral). Quorum-of-2
judge gate with provenance tag (replaces v3.1 cloud-only wording). Explicit
3-tier graceful-degradation map (Tier 3 = today's harness; HAMR is strict
superset). Revised 9-child MVP across 5 waves (~18 working days). Wave 1
children filed as #891–#896. Source: research/hamr-v3-2-2026-05-04.md.
Supersedes: research/hamr-v3-2026-05-04.md.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR Spike S4 — Anthropic prompt-cache economics (#879, EPIC #860)
Lane converted from code-change to docs-research after env check showed no
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; live measurement deferred. Analytical validation of v3's
72% effective token-cost reduction claim using Anthropic's published cache
pricing (write 1.25×, read 0.10×, 5-min ephemeral / 1-h extended). Decision:
**CONFIRM v3's 72% claim** — derives 73.5% at 10-call session, 83.3% at
100-call, 65.6% at 5-call (all meet ≥72% target when hit rate ≥80%).
Recommend 1-h extended cache for HAMR's 15-60 min session shape; bundle-
rebuild cadence must be rate-limited to ≥5 min for ephemeral amortization.
Spike script + operator-run instructions documented in §5 (gitignored). Spend
expected ~$0.07 (under $0.50 cap). Source:
research/hamr-spike-s4-prompt-cache-2026-05-04.md.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR Spike S3 — Substrate latency analysis (#878, EPIC #860)
Lane converted from code-change to docs-research after S2 #877 capability probe
showed operator environment has no Wrangler/R2; live deploy deferred. Measured
+ cited per-segment latency budget. Verdict: **REVISE** v3's ≤80 ms claim —
cold paths measure 108–116 ms p50 (exceed by 28–36 ms); warm cache-hit paths
hit 54 ms p50 / 80 ms p95 (satisfy claim). Required revisions: scope claim to
warm-connection only, mandate HTTP/2 keepalive, mandate KV edge-cache via
Cache-Control headers, revise `npx megingjord init` 60 ms sample. Tailscale
fleet RTT: windows-laptop 5 ms, 36gbwinresource 11 ms, penguin-1 64 ms p50.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR Spike S6 — Build-vs-adopt + STRIDE threat model (#881, EPIC #860)
Two-part deliverable: (a) per-child build-vs-adopt matrix for the 9 surviving
HAMR MVP children — counts ADOPT 2 / BUILD 4 / HYBRID 3 / REUSE 0; one
license-incompatible library flagged (TruffleHog AGPL-3.0, rejected as direct
dep); (b) formal STRIDE threat model across 5 adversary classes × 6 STRIDE
categories — 9 of 30 cells residual MEDIUM or HIGH after existing mitigations.
Four required HAMR design changes (DC-1: signed A2A mailbox envelopes; DC-2:
slsa-verifier pre-MCP-connect; DC-3: hardware-bound DPoP key; DC-4: signed
baton handoff artifacts + non-fleet judge gate). Sources:
research/hamr-spike-s6-build-vs-adopt-2026-05-04.md and
research/hamr-spike-s6-threat-model-2026-05-04.md.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR Spike S5 — Distillation rule-coverage (#880, EPIC #860)
Empirical compression-vs-rule-coverage curve for our 22,480-char governance
text. Two methods tested in parallel: deterministic top-k extractive (47-
keyword vocabulary) and Cerebras llama3.1-8b LLM rewrite. Both saturate at
~32% of source size (≈68% tokens saved) before hitting an irreducible-rule
floor. 20-question quiz graded by Cerebras llama3.1-8b scored 20/20 at every
level on both methods. Decision: REVISE v3's ≥97% target upward to ≥99%
keyword-coverage; introduce two-stage gate (cheap keyword + periodic
reasoning-grounded). Source: research/hamr-spike-s5-distillation-2026-05-04.md.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR Spike S1 — Existing Code Audit (#876, EPIC #860)
Audit of 20 modules against HAMR v3 13-child MVP plan. Decision counts:
REUSE 3, REFACTOR 11, REPLACE 3, MERGE 3. Revised HAMR child count: 9
(down from 13). Four prospective children absorbed into refactors of
`cascade-dispatch.js`, `model-routing-engine.js`, `litellm-client.js`,
`token-provider-adapters.js`, `wiki/anneal.js`. Three modules slated for
REPLACE: `agent-coord-remote.js`, `cloudflare/worker.ts`,
`cloudflare/durable-object.ts`. Source: research/hamr-spike-s1-code-audit-2026-05-04.md.

## [2026-05-03] update | Token telemetry drift reconciliation (#774)

Per-vendor skill/tool surfaces designed for Claude Code, Copilot, Codex, Continue.dev, Cursor, Aider. Heavy fleet usage: Cerebras 235B (Q5-Q10), 36gbwinresource qwen2.5-coder:32b (Q4), Groq llama-3.3-70b (Q1-Q3). Implementation children deferred to client review.

## [2026-05-04] research | Dashboard closed-state hygiene (#852)
Research-only deliverable for child of EPIC #848. Decision: Linear-style default-hide + toggle with Height-style condensed historical attribution. Single Groq llama-3.3-70b dispatch (zero paid LLM tokens). Implementation children NOT spawned — awaiting client review.

## [2026-05-04] research | Dashboard layout density heuristics (#854)
Research-only deliverable for child of EPIC #850. Produced per-panel sizing matrix and desktop/laptop/mobile wireframe baselines with panel consolidation rationale. Heavy fleet usage evidence captured from capability probe + routing refresh + fleet benchmark (36gbwinresource strongest throughput). Implementation children NOT spawned — awaiting client review.

## [2026-05-04] research | Fleet harness-awareness v2 (#863, EPIC #860, supersedes v1 #861)

Heavy fleet usage via sub-agent + websearch.

## [2026-05-04] research | HAMR v3 — 5-axis optimization (#873, EPIC #860)
2226-word v3 research deliverable. Acronym formalized as **HAMR — Harness-Aware Mesh Routing**. Optimizes v2 design across security (SLSA-L3 + OIDC + Cosign Bundle 1.0 + MCP OAuth+DPoP + capability manifests), UX (npx init + magic-link OAuth + progressive disclosure + hamr:status), token-min (per-tier sub-bundles + JSON Patch + LLMLingua-2 distillation + structured outputs; ~80% reduction), paid-token min (Batch APIs 50% off + sticky cache routing + context-editing + header-driven spillover), maintenance (Wrangler 4.x + Tail Workers + R2 lifecycle + schema versioning). 4 new MVP children (SLSA pipeline, per-tier bundle generator, constitution compressor, Batch API). Heavy fleet usage via sub-agent + websearch.
