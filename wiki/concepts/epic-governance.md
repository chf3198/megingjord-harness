# Epic Governance

## Summary

Rules for epic ticket lifecycle: role ownership, status advancement, progress tracking,
and close conditions. Epics are parent containers; all active work happens in child tickets.

## Role Boundary

- Epic always carries `role:manager`. Never reassigned during active child work.
- Child tickets carry the active agent's role label (`role:collaborator`, etc.).
- The Agent Baton displayed on child tickets reflects current execution; epic label is constant.

## Status Advancement Table

| Epic Status     | Condition to Advance             |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| `triage`        | Scope defined, children created  |
| `ready`         | All children triaged              |
| `in-progress`   | ≥1 child `in-progress`           |
| `review`        | All children `done` or terminal  |
| `done`/closed   | See close conditions below       |

## Progress Comment Protocol

Post a progress comment to the epic when:
1. A child ticket reaches `done` (closed)
2. A child ticket is cancelled (`status:cancelled`)
3. A new child is added after triage

Format: `Progress: #NNN <title> → done/cancelled. Children: X/Y complete.`

## Close Conditions (all required)

1. All child tickets are terminal (`done`, `cancelled`, or `wont-fix`)
2. CONSULTANT_CLOSEOUT comment posted on epic
3. Resolution label set (`resolution:completed` or appropriate variant)
4. Epic closed with `stateReason: COMPLETED`

## Branch Naming

- Child ticket work: `feat/<child-issue-number>-<slug>`
- **Never** name a branch after the epic number
