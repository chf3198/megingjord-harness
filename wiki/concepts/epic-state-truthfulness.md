# Epic-State Truthfulness

## Summary

Epic-state truthfulness is the property that an Epic's narrative, labels,
checkboxes, child-ticket graph, dependencies, and closeout evidence all describe
the same state. The failure mode is a Manager narrative declaring completion
while AC checkboxes or blocking dependencies still prove otherwise.

## Details

The Codex #1274 plan recommends seven controls:

1. Deterministic AC reconciliation table.
2. Epic close-readiness gate that fails narrative/AC mismatch.
3. `EPIC_RESCOPE` artifact for changed or waived ACs.
4. `status:measuring` plus `Recheck-after` for time-windowed ACs.
5. Cross-Epic dependency graph with cycle detection.
6. Consultant-only final Epic verification.
7. GHS sensor for declared-complete-but-unmet-AC drift.

The design follows the Karpathy wiki pattern by storing raw research, a source
summary, and this distilled concept separately, then cross-linking the concept
to existing governance pages.
